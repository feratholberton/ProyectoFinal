# ELIO: Security and Compliance

## Data Management Policy
**IMPORTANT:** All information acquired through the ELIO system is transmitted directly to the hospital's secure servers. No data persistence occurs within the ELIO application itself. This "zero-footprint" approach enhances security by ensuring that sensitive medical information is only stored in authorized hospital repositories.

## Data Flow
1. User inputs medical record information through ELIO interface
2. Data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
3. Information is transmitted directly to hospital server
4. No local copies or caches of patient data are maintained
5. Transaction logs record only metadata of operations (no PHI)

## Data Retention
- ELIO does not maintain persistent storage of medical records
- All patient data resides exclusively on hospital-managed systems
- Temporary processing data is purged after transmission completion
- No backup copies are created within the ELIO environment

## Security Architecture

ELIO handles sensitive medical information and implements comprehensive security measures:

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Configurable session expiration
- Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- Password policy enforcement

### Data Protection
- Data encryption at rest
- TLS/SSL for all communications
- Input sanitization to prevent injections
- Parameterized queries

### Auditing and Logging
- Complete system action logging
- Medical record change tracking
- Suspicious activity alerts
- Immutable audit logs for compliance

## Regulatory Compliance

ELIO is designed with the following regulations in mind:

- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- Local Data Protection Laws

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security breach or incident:

1. Incident detection and containment
2. Impact and scope assessment
3. Notification to affected parties per regulatory requirements
4. Implementation of corrective measures
5. Post-incident documentation and analysis

## Risk Assessment

A comprehensive risk assessment has been conducted addressing:

- Unauthorized data access
- Data loss or corruption
- System availability
- Regulatory compliance
- Internal and external threats

## Vulnerability Management

- Regular security scans
- Timely patching and updates
- Vulnerability reporting program
- Periodic penetration testing

## Deployment Recommendations

- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
- Full database encryption
- Network segmentation
- Encrypted backups on regular schedule
- Continuous activity monitoring
- Intrusion Detection Systems

## Data Privacy

ELIO implements privacy by design principles:
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Storage limitation
- Data subject access rights
- Consent management
- Right to be forgotten compliance

## Security Training

It is recommended that all users of the system receive training on:
- Secure credential management
- Identifying phishing attempts
- Social engineering awareness
- Proper handling of PHI (Protected Health Information)
- Incident reporting procedures

## Third-Party Security

- Vendor security assessment
- API security for integrations
- Regular security reviews of dependencies
- Secure API key management
