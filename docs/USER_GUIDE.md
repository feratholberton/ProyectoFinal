### Best Practices for Consultations

#### Writing Effective Questions

**Good Questions:**
```
"What are the security best practices for storing passwords in a database?"

"How do I implement pagination in a REST API with Node.js?"

"What's the difference between JWT and session-based authentication?"
```

**Avoid:**
```
"Help" (too vague)
"What should I do?" (no context)
"Fix my code" (no details provided)
```

#### Getting Better Responses

1. **Be Specific**: Include relevant details
2. **Provide Context**: Explain what you're trying to achieve
3. **Ask One Thing**: Focus on one topic per consultation
4. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid jargon or abbreviations
5. **Include Examples**: Show what you've tried

#### Example: Before and After

**Before (Vague):**
```
Question: "How do I make my app faster?"
```

**After (Specific):**
```
Question: "How can I reduce the load time of my Angular application? 
It currently takes 5 seconds to load the initial page."

Context: "I'm using Angular 20 with server-side rendering. 
The main bundle size is 2MB."
```
