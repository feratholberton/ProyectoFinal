# Backend Documentation

## Description
This is the backend for **proyecto Final ELIO**, responsible for handling server logic, database communication, and exposing the API for the frontend.

## Project Structure
The main structure of the backend is as follows:

- `/src` - Contains the backend source code.
  - `/controllers` - Handles HTTP requests.
  - `/models` - Defines data models to interact with the database.
  - `/routes` - API route definitions.
  - `/middlewares` - Middleware for request handling.
- `/config` - Server and database configuration.
- `/tests` - Unit and integration tests.
- `server.js` - Main entry point for the server.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **NPM** or **Yarn** for package management
- **Database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and run the backend:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/proyectoFinal.git
   cd proyectoFinal
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory (if separate) and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file at the root. Example:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=1234
   DB_NAME=my_database
   PORT=3000
   ```

## Usage
To start the server, use:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will run at [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000) by default (you can change the port in the `.env` file).

## Main Endpoints
Check the full API documentation in the `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file (coming soon).

```
Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes.
