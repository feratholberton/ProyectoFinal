# Backend Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the backend for **proyectoFinalELIO**, including code organization, main components, and their interaction.

---

## Overview

The backend is designed to be modular and scalable, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities and easy extensibility. It uses [mention main technologies, e.g., Node.js, Express, etc.] to handle business logic and database communication.

---

## Main Components

### 1. **Controllers (`controllers/`)**
- Process HTTP requests, invoke necessary business logic, and return appropriate responses.
- Example: `userController.js` handles user-related operations (registration, login, etc.).

### 2. **Models (`models/`)**
- Define the data schema and provide methods for database interaction.
- Example: `User.js` defines the schema for user data.

### 3. **Routes (`routes/`)**
- Define entry points for HTTP requests and map them to the corresponding controllers.
- Example: `userRoutes.js` defines routes for user-related endpoints (`/login`, `/register`, etc.).

### 4. **Middlewares (`middlewares/`)**
- Functions that execute before reaching controllers, used for tasks like authentication, data validation, error handling, etc.
- Example: `authMiddleware.js` verifies authentication tokens in protected requests.

### 5. **Configuration (`config/`)**
- Configuration files for the project, such as database connections, environment variables, and global settings.

### 6. **Tests (`tests/`)**
- Scripts and test cases to validate backend functionality.
- Includes both unit and integration tests.

### 7. **Main File (`server.js`)**
- Entry point for the backend, initializing the server, routes, database, and other services.

## Data Flow

1. **Client**: Sends an HTTP request through an API endpoint.
2. **Routes**: The request is routed to the appropriate controller.
3. **Controllers**: Process the request, validate data, and call necessary services or models.
4. **Models**: Interact with the database to retrieve or store data.
5. **Response**: The controller sends an HTTP response back to the client.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **[Database System]**: Describe the database system used (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **[Other Libraries]**: Mention additional important libraries (e.g., `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, etc.).

---

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each component has a clear and independent responsibility.
- **Scalability**: The architecture allows adding new modules or functionalities without affecting existing ones.
- **Security**: Middlewares are used to protect sensitive routes and validate requests.
